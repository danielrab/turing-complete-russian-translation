The length of our week is 4 days. Our weekdays are named Zero's day, One's day, Two's day and Three's day. I hear some earthlings number their Two's day incorrectly? 
	
It doesn't really surprise me.

In this level you are given a number as input and you should return that number modulo 4 as a result.

The challenge is that you only have {ticks_per_test} ticks to output the desired result.

Note, you don't need to change your hardware, you just have to figure out the trick to do modulo 4 quickly.
Use [color=#e63e5b][url=masking_time]this hint[/url][/color] if you get stuck.
