# The circuit you are asked to construct here has a circular dependency. The circuit also has 2 "stable states" for most inputs. A stable state here means that every component's output agrees with its input. As an example, an OR gate with one input disconnected and the other connected to its own output is stable. If the output is [OFF], both inputs are [OFF], which agrees with the OR gate. If the output is [ON], then so is one of the inputs. However, a NOT gate connected to its own input is not stable. If the output is [ON], then the input is [ON] as well. This will cause the NOT gate to try and make the output [OFF], which will also make the input [OFF]. The circuit will switch between these two states forever, so it is not stable.
