$18761197388580* In order to cut spending, it has been decided to change the queuing system at public offices so that fewer people will go. Instead of first come, first served, we are implementing a last come first served policy. Think of it like a [color=#e49f44]stack[/color] of numbered slips where the citizens either put a slip on top (called [color=#e49f44]PUSH[/color]), or the bureaucrats take one off the top of the stack (called [color=#e49f44]POP[/color]). We want you to implement this new system.
