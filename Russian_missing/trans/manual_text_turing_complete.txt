Certain computers, like simple calculators are limited in the algorithms they can perform.

They cannot perform any calculation that requires looping or recursing an arbitrary amount of times. Technically machines without looping or recursion can only deal with combinational logic.

Turing complete machines on the other hand are as powerful as it is possible to be. A Turing complete machine may have a slow CPU, but it is powerful in the sense that there is no (computable) algorithm it can't perform.
