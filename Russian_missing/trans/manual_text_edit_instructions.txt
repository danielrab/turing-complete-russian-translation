After you complete the level "Turing Complete" the instruction panel allows you to manually edit instructions. This is useful if you wish to build your own computers.

If you just finished the OVERTURE computer and see something weird, odds are you may have changed the definitions.

Each row has a label and 8 bits you can set to either[img]dialogue/on.png[/img], [img]dialogue/off.png[/img] or [img]dialogue/any.png[/img] (wildcard). When using the instruction panel, if the bitpattern matches a row, the label will be shown.
