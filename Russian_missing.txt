Hard disks are made of a spinning disk and a mechanical arm that has to physically move to load or save data. Of course physical movement is extremely slow in the timescales of electronics. Operating systems will normally order loads and saves such that the arm has to travel as little as possible.

The hard disk component has a "seek" pin, which lets you change the address you are looking at by the given amount. The addresses "wrap around", such that seeking 1 less than 0 moves you to the highest address, and seeking 1 higher than that gets you back to 0.

You can use a mix of assembly codes and numbers to set the bytes. Assembly codes are just synonyms for a bit pattern. For example, instead of typing 196 for "add", this code can be named "add" directly, simplifying reading and writing code. 

Comments can be added using "#". 
[img]dialogue/comment.png[/img]

Additionally, the [color=#c54d5e]CONST[/color] keyword can be used to name a value within a specific program. 
[img]dialogue/const.png[/img]

[color=#c54d5e]LABEL[/color] assigns a name to the byte offset of the line it was inserted on. This is especially useful for naming jump destinations.
[img]dialogue/label.png[/img]

You can add, subtract, multiply, integer divide, modulo, OR, AND or XOR values together using +, -, *, /, %, |, & or ^ respectively.

Breakpoints can be added by clicking to the left of a line number. The program will automatically pause at breakpoints when running.
[img]dialogue/breakpoint.png[/img]

Breakpoints can also be added to any of the linked components, pausing the program when that state is changed. Click on the state and you will see the red dot.
[img]dialogue/breakpoint_state.png[/img]

Finally, values can be specified in binary with the prefix 0b (so 5 could be 0b0101) and hex with the prefix 0x (so 15 would be 0x0f)

$52013630755752*
In real hardware all components have delay. This is important since the delay in a circuit determines the maximum speed at which you can run it.

Following wires from input to output and adding the delay of components in the path will give you the delay that path. The delay of a circuit is the delay of the slowest path.

Besides inputs, paths can also start from components with no reliance on early phase inputs (like Counter and On) and they can end at late phase inputs (see page).

Further, custom components don't have a delay score for the costliest path of the whole component, but rather the delay cost is calculated per pin. This is so as to not penalize using custom components by making faster pins cost the same as the slower ones.

This game asks you to build an 8 bit computer.  Practically this would normally require the player to put down 8 parallel wire lines in many places.
To alleviate tedious busywork, you are given the notion of a byte, which is just a virtual bundle of 8 bits.

The state of either a byte input / output or wire line is represented by a number, instead of the red or green color.

If components output different values on the same wire, you get an error. However, some components have grey output pins, these are not outputting at all when the component is not enabled. This is the case for the Bit Switch component.

[img]dialogue/bit_switch.png[/img]

This means that more than 1 of these grey output pins can connect to the same wire and not cause an error, as long as only one of them is enabled at a time.

$17263901743088*
Build a counter that will increase by 1 each tick.

Additionally, there should be an option for overwriting the counter with a given value.

You are given 2 inputs, a bit and a byte.

The bit input should toggle between counting and overwriting with the value of the byte.
$10555159894041*
Counting is so fundamental even insects do it. From counting, species can evolve to compare and do arithmetic. And before you know it, you have apes building computers.

Make a device that counts increments once per tick.


=== trans/manual_text_ram ===

$10969790213397*
This simulator has several types of RAM different trade-offs, similar to real life RAM options.

[b]RAM[/b]
The RAM component can store a lot of data, but adds a very high delay to the circuit.

[b]Fast RAM[/b]
The fast RAM has a low delay, but a very high gate cost per byte.

[b]Latency RAM[/b]
The normal RAM has very high delay, however instead of waiting for this delay each tick, we can treat the RAM as if load and save takes multiple ticks. The number of ticks save and load will take depends on the length of each tick. Say for example that our circuit has a delay of 100 units, a load would take 10 ticks, since we have to wait about 1000 units of delay. 

A common approach for pipelined architectures is to use Latency RAM as for main memory, but use a small amount of Fast RAM for caching. Since memory access is often adjacent or close (for example when looping over an array), fetching adjacent values when loading from Latency RAM and caching them in Fast RAM can significantly speed up certain kinds of programs.

The simplest way to integrate the Latency RAM is simply to stall the whole architecture while waiting for a save or load. An easy optimization on this comes from realizing that you don't have to wait for saves, except if you want to load.

[b]Dual Load RAM[/b]
Sometimes it is beneficial to separate parts of the logic into a separate processing unit, that operates more or less independently. This could be for handling a display device or a network connection. In these cases, the independent unit will often need to continuously load and save to memory, while the outside logic only needs to occasionally load. Use Dual Laod RAM to avoid having to schedule who gets access to the RAM at what time.

[OFF] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [OFF] would become:
[ON] [ON] [OFF] [ON] [OFF] [OFF] [OFF] [OFF]

However, by disconnecting output pins from a wire, it is possible for multiple pins to share the same wire (called a bus). Importantly, at most 1 component output should remain connected each tick, otherwise you risk a short circuit.

$16009852370452*
When dealing with a lot of bits, binary can become hard to read. Hexadecimal (base 16) represents each combination of 4 bits as its own character:
[code]
0 [OFF][OFF][OFF][OFF]
1 [OFF][OFF][OFF][ON]
2 [OFF][OFF][ON][OFF]
3 [OFF][OFF][ON][ON]
4 [OFF][ON][OFF][OFF]
5 [OFF][ON][OFF][ON]
6 [OFF][ON][ON][OFF]
7 [OFF][ON][ON][ON]
8 [ON][OFF][OFF][OFF]
9 [ON][OFF][OFF][ON]
A [ON][OFF][ON][OFF]
B [ON][OFF][ON][ON]
C [ON][ON][OFF][OFF]
D [ON][ON][OFF][ON]
E [ON][ON][ON][OFF]
F [ON][ON][ON][ON]
[/code]

As an example where hexadecimal is much clearer, lets compare the representation of the largest 16 bit number:
[code]
Binary:      1111111111111111
Decimal:     65535
Hexadecimal: FFFF
[/code]

It is not easy to tell if the binary is missing a digit or if the decimal number is off by 1, the hexadecimal on the other hand is immediately clear (once you get used to the representation at least).

Certain computers, like simple calculators are limited in the algorithms they can perform.

They cannot perform any calculation that requires looping or recursing an arbitrary amount of times. Technically machines without looping or recursion can only deal with combinational logic.

Turing complete machines on the other hand are as powerful as it is possible to be. A Turing complete machine may have a slow CPU, but it is powerful in the sense that there is no (computable) algorithm it can't perform.

Modern computers are not built entirely of just one of the universal gates, but when applicable NAND gates are preferred over NOR, because they have less delay and occupy less area.

The way to represent negative numbers you discovered is called "two's complement". It is the standard way to represent negative numbers in modern computers. The main advantage of two's complement is that the negative representation works seamlessly with the same adder that we used for the non signed representation.

In the early days of computing, the main contender to two's complement was one's complement. Its main advantage is that changing the sign of a number is simple, you just NOT each bit in the number. However, it has 2 representations for 0, a positive and a negative, which makes comparisons more difficult.

Another interesting representation, perhaps worth looking up is base -2, where the sign of the value of each digit alternates between positive and negative.

$15840165316981*
In this level you are tasked with implementing function calls and returns with the [color=#e49f44]call[/color] and [color=#e49f44]ret[/color] instructions.

Note that when returning from a function, you should jump to the address that came AFTER the [color=#e49f44]call[/color] instruction, otherwise you will end with an infinite loop.
The [color=#e49f44]call[/color] instruction has to do the following:
 [i]- Add the instruction width to the counter value and [color=#e49f44]push[/color] it on the stack[/i]
 [i]- Jump to the function address[/i]

The [color=#e49f44]ret[/color] instruction has to do the following:
 [i]- [color=#e49f44]Pop[/color] return address from the stack and jump to it[/i]

You can pass information to and from a function by saving the data to registers as normal. Also be aware of which registers a function will overwrite before calling it.

$69488982380310*
The numbers you are used to are base 10, here when we add a 0 to the right hand side of a number, it's value increases 10 fold.

Binary is base 2, so doing the same will instead just double it. In other words, each digit represents a power of 2. For example with [color=#c54d5e]base 2[/color] and [color=#e49f44]base 10[/color] color coded:
[color=#c54d5e]    1[/color] = [color=#e49f44]1[/color]
[color=#c54d5e]  10[/color] = [color=#e49f44]2[/color]
[color=#c54d5e]100[/color] = [color=#e49f44]4[/color]

To represent 6 we can simply add 4 and 2:
[color=#c54d5e]110[/color] = [color=#e49f44]6[/color]

Addition, multiplication and everything else works the same as base 10, except you carry when you reach 2 instead of 10.

The program component is a read only memory component, that can have its data programmed in assembly. To edit the assembly, click on the yellow edit icon in the corner of the component.

[center][img]dialogue/manual/program_edit.png[/img][/center]

In the middle of the screen you will see the code area, read more about the assembly [color=#4d82c5][url=Assembly]here[/url][/color].

On the left hand side of the assembly editor interface, you can add assembly codes (mnemonics). Assembly codes act as a replacement for numbers, so instead of remembering what number represents the AND instruction in your architecture, you can add "AND" to your assembly codes, making code easier to read and write.

[center][img]dialogue/manual/assembly_codes.png[/img][/center]

On the program component you will also find the "Watch state" button. 

[center][img]dialogue/manual/watch_state.png[/img][/center]

This can be used to connect the assembly editor to registers, counters or probes. This way, the state of your architecture can be inspected as you write code, without closing the editor.

[b]Showing letters[/b]
It just so happens that a pixel space of 5x7 while small is still able to render letters nicely. By adding an extra row and column, these letters will also look nice when put next to each other. 

[center][img]dialogue/manual/matrix_letter.png[/img][/center]


[b]Small tileable screen[/b]
Rotating the component, you get 8x6 pixels, which has a nice 4:3 aspect ratio and tiling these, you can get most resolutions you might want. The way the pins are set up on this component was specifically designed to allow tiling. Imagine the naive pin design where each component is enabled by a single bit. This would require you to connect 1 wire for each component. In this situation, the number of wires needed for a tiled screen would scale with the area, while the gap needed to fit wires between components, would scale with the circumference. 

[center][img]dialogue/manual/tilable_screen.png[/img][/center]

Instead, by having 2 enable pins, one wire can enable a whole row and another a whole column. This way, a single component can be selected by its unique row and column combination. Further, fitting the rest of the data on the same wires, means that the horizontal and vertical gaps only need to be 1 square wide. This component visually takes up half a square extra on all sides, such that these components can be tiled up pixel perfectly, with 1 square hidden between them for running wires.

#  hint for counting signals

#  hint for saving gracefully
$25321701584378*
In this level you need to use 1 Delay Line. Make a truth table for what should go into the Delay Line. Consider the input to the Delay Line as the output for your table. 

The inputs are the 2 level inputs AND the output of the Delay Line, as the output plays a role in its input. In total you have 3 "inputs" to for this table which gives you 8 combinations. Once you have the level requirements as a table, it should be a lot easier to solve.

#  Hint for conditions
$87674181578455*
There are 3 condition bits. The first bit being [ON] means the result being 0 meets the condition. The second bit being [ON] means the result being less than 0 meets the condition. If either of those two are [ON], the condition is met. 
Finally, if the last bit is [ON], negate the status of the condition being met or not.

#  hint for xor gate
$88963098241493* This level can be done with 3 components, a NAND, an AND and an OR gate.

#  Hint for masking time
$46866534894828*
In binary, taking modulo 4 of a number is the same as only using the two lower bits. This is because the higher bits represent 4, 8, 16 etc, and they all divide 4 with no remainder.
This is true in general for modulo a power of 2, the lowest bit of a number represents that number modulo 2 (even or odd), the lowest 3 bits modulo 8 and so on.

Likewise, in decimal 4321 modulo 100 is also simple (answer is 21, the higher digits are disregarded), this is because 100 is a power of 10.

Now you just have to figure out how to get the last 2 digits of a number.

#  hint for less
$56438995128380*
First determine which bits are different between the 2 bytes. This can be done using a byte XOR (remember XOR turns [ON] when the inputs are not the same). We know the number that has the highest different bit [ON] is the larger number. But we must only consider the highest different bit, so for each bit, use a chain of OR gates to check if any higher are [ON].
		
Finally, the last bit is considered separately for signed numbers, here it has the opposite effect (if only one number has it [ON], that number is guaranteed to be lower)

Open the component factory by clicking on this button [img]dialogue/manual/component_factory_icon.png[/img] in the upper left bar.

The component factory allows you to create your own components. The logic you place determine the behavior of the custom component and the layout determines the shape. 

The input and output components you place become pins on the component. Like with other components, a component output leading back to its input causes a circular dependency. Outputs having a path back to inputs causes a circular dependency for custom components, even if the insides of the component would suggest there shouldn't be one. Not having to worry about the inside of components reduces the complexity of larger builds, however this strict abstraction can be inconvenient under certain circumstances. In that case, use the unbuffered pins. They allow bidirectional flow and use the insides of the component to check for circular dependencies.

Probes placed in custom components will show on their layout and can display values inside. Probes can be connected to other custom components, so that deeply nested values can be displayed. Values probed in this way can also be connected to the program component.

For the component factory, the file manager also manages the custom components. The file names decide the component name and the folder structure decides the components placement in the menu.

[b]Overview[/b]
The "Network" component gives you low level access to networking. In general you manipulate your network by sending the component [color=#e49f44]Requests[/color] and when update [color=#39aa49]Events[/color] return from the network they get queued up and you process them one at a time. To keep track of different simultaneous connections [color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color]s are used.

These are the request types you can send to the component and their arguments:
[code]0[/code] No request
[code]1[/code] [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Port[/color])
[code]2[/code] [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color] ([color=#dd6576]IP[/color], [color=#dd6576]Port[/color])
[code]3[/code] [color=#e49f44]Send data[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color], [color=#dd6576]Data[/color], [color=#dd6576]Data length[/color])
[code]4[/code] [color=#e49f44]Close[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color])
[code]5[/code] [color=#e49f44]Read next event[/color]
[i]See component panel for which pin correspond to which argument.[/i]

Request types [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color] and [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color] outputs the [color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color] of the new connection.

For 2 programs to [color=#e49f44]Send data[/color] to each other, one program must first [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color] (called a server) on a [color=#dd6576]Port[/color] and the other must then [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color] (called a client), using the [color=#dd6576]IP[/color] of the listening program and the [color=#dd6576]Port[/color] it selected. Once the connection is established, the server and client function exactly the same.

Notice an [color=#dd6576]IP[/color] is a 32 bit number, normally written as 4 bytes with dots in between (example: 127.0.0.1). In this simulator you reverse the order of the bytes, so 127.0.0.1 becomes 0x0100007F. 0x0100007F is always your computers loopback address and you can use this to connect programs running on the same computer.

You can detect when events happen on the network, by checking the "Next event type" pin. These are the event types:
[code]0[/code] No event
[code]1[/code] [color=#39aa49]Incoming connection[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color], [color=#dd6576]Port[/color])
[code]2[/code] [color=#39aa49]Connect complete[/color]
[code]3[/code] [color=#39aa49]Receive data[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID, Data[/color], [color=#dd6576]Data length[/color])
[code]4[/code] [color=#39aa49]Connection closed[/color] ([color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color] / [color=#dd6576]Error code[/color])

[color=#39aa49]Incoming connection[/color] only happens after a [color=#e49f44]Listen[/color]. Use the [color=#dd6576]Port[/color] to distinguish between listeners (it is not possible to listen to the same port twice at the same time).

[color=#39aa49]Connect complete[/color] only happens after a [color=#e49f44]Connect[/color], wait for this before you start sending data.

You may send or receive between 1 and 8 bytes of data at a time, use the [color=#dd6576]Data length[/color] to decide.

A connection may be either "possibly open" or "closed". There is no way to know if a connection is actually open other than sending data. The underlying network protocols were designed like this for reliability and speed, it is not a limitation of the simulator.

If you get a [color=#dd6576]Connection ID[/color] of -1, this means there was an error connecting.

In this level, components may depend on themselves or form loops of up to two components. Despite depending on their own output, some of these wires have stable outputs, at least for some inputs.

The circuit you are asked to construct here has a circular dependency. The circuit also has 2 "stable states" for most inputs. A stable state here means that every component's output agrees with its input. As an example, an OR gate with one input disconnected and the other connected to its own output is stable. If the output is [OFF], both inputs are [OFF], which agrees with the OR gate. If the output is [ON], then so is one of the inputs. However, a NOT gate connected to its own input is not stable. If the output is [ON], then the input is [ON] as well. This will cause the NOT gate to try and make the output [OFF], which will also make the input [OFF]. The circuit will switch between these two states forever, so it is not stable.
$18165461234561* Delay lines are easy to understand and can be used to build any computer architecture. However, modern hardware no longer use these as a basis for memory.

$14960344494328*
Sometimes it is useful to load a value directly from the program instead of from registers. This is called loading an immediate value. In the [color=#e49f44]LEG[/color] architecture we signal when we want to do this directly in the opcode. We can do that in the following way:
	
When the 8th bit of the opcode is [ON], use argument 1 as an immediate value, instead of as a register address.
When the 7th bit of the opcode is [ON], use argument 2 as an immediate value, instead of as a register address.

The [color=#e49f44]LEG[/color] architecture is a computer that takes 4 bytes per tick from the program. 

The first byte describes the operation (called the [color=#e49f44]OPCODE[/color]).

Since many operations take 2 arguments (like ADD, OR etc), the second and third byte are for arguments.

And since most operations return 1 result, the fourth byte is for the result.

$10912834168905*
Finally, in this level the [color=#e49f44]OPCODE[/color] is always 0. This means we ADD argument 1 and argument 2 and save the result to the destination.

The value of an argument or destination refers to one of these places:
[code]
[color=#e49f44]0[/color]: Register 0
[color=#e49f44]1[/color]: Register 1
[color=#e49f44]2[/color]: Register 2
[color=#e49f44]3[/color]: Register 3
[color=#e49f44]4[/color]: Register 4
[color=#e49f44]5[/color]: Register 5
[color=#e49f44]6[/color]: Counter
[color=#e49f44]7[/color]: Input/Output
[/code]

In the next level you will implement more [color=#e49f44]OPCODES[/color], which will require a different ALU than that of [color=#e49f44]OVERTURE[/color].
