The color pin uses byte 2, 3 and 4 for [color=#dd6576][url=RGB color]RGB color[/url][/color] (byte 1 is unused)
The pixel pin uses byte 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for selecting pixels to be colored, where each bit corresponds to a pixel. Updates are only visible once byte 8 is set to 1, this "flushes" the changes and updates the display visually.

Both "Enable X" and "Enable Y" have to be on to update the display.
