[b]Showing letters[/b]
It just so happens that a pixel space of 5x7 while small is still able to render letters nicely. By adding an extra row and column, these letters will also look nice when put next to each other.

Rotating the component, you get 8x6 pixels, which has a nice 4:3 aspect ratio and tiling these, you can get most resolutions you might want. The way the pins are set up on this component was specifically designed to allow tiling. Imagine the naive pin design where each component is enabled by a single bit. This would require you to connect 1 wire for each component. In this situation, the number of wires needed for a tiled screen would scale with the area, while the gap needed to fit wires between components, would scale with the circumference.

Instead, by having 2 enable pins, one wire can enable a whole row and another a whole column. This way, a single component can be selected by its unique row and column combination. Further, fitting the rest of the data on the same wires, means that the horizontal and vertical gaps only need to be 1 square wide. This component visually takes up half a square extra on all sides, such that these components can be tiled up pixel perfectly, with 1 square hidden between them for running wires.
