In electronics, two components outputting different values on the same wire causes a short circuit.

However, by disconnecting output pins from a wire, it is possible for multiple pins to share the same wire (called a bus). Importantly, at most 1 component output should remain connected each tick, otherwise you risk a short circuit.

In this simulator, pins that can be disconnected are grey.
