The first 4 inputs will give you the following in order:
disk_nr - The highest disk number in the pile (2 to 4)
source - Which location number to move from
destination - Where to move the pile to
spare - The 3rd spot that is neither the source nor the destination

Control the crane with the following outputs:
0 - Move the magnet to spot 0
1 - Move the magnet to spot 1
2 - Move the magnet to spot 2

Implement the following algorithm:

Tower of Hanoi algorithm:[code][color=#87a8c8]
func move(disk_nr, source, dest, spare):
	if disk_nr is 0:
		move disk from source to dest
	else:
		move(disk_nr - 1, source, spare, dest)
		move disk from source to dest
		move(disk_nr - 1, spare, dest, source)

move(disk_nr, source, dest, spare)[/color][/code]
