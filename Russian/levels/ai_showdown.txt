Game rules: There are 12 cards on the table and each player takes turn and must pick up between 1 and 3 cards. You start and the player who picks up the last card (the joker) loses.

Reading input will give you the current number of cards. Sending 1, 2 or 3 to output will pick up that number of cards. NAK 02 reacts immediately, so you may read the input immediately after your output to get the result of his action.
