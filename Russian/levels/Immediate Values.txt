Sometimes it is useful to load a value directly from the program instead of from registers. This is called loading an immediate value. In the [color=#e49f44]LEG[/color] architecture we signal when we want to do this directly in the opcode. We can do that in the following way:
	
When the 8th bit of the opcode is [ON], use argument 1 as an immediate value, instead of as a register address.
When the 7th bit of the opcode is [ON], use argument 2 as an immediate value, instead of as a register address.
