Time to merge in the "Arithmetic Engine" circuit you made previously with the register circuit. The calculation circuit was saved in the component factory and can now be added as a component. If you forgot which pin does what, check the circuit in the component factory.

Use the decoder you built to figure out if we should copy between registers or do calculations. Here are the 4 different modes again:
[OFF][OFF] Immediate
[OFF][ON] Calculate
[ON][OFF] Copy
[ON][ON] Condition

For this level you only have to worry about the copy and calculate mode, check the [INSTRUCTIONS] by clicking on [img=20]dialogue/instruction_icon.png[/img] in the top panel for the details. When in calculate mode, take [color=#e49f44]REG 1[/color] and [color=#e49f44]REG 2[/color] as inputs, and save the result in [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color].

[tip]Don't forget the 3 bit decoder component has a disable bit.[/tip]
$16133643476631* The circuit you built in the "Registers" level can copy values between registers, while the "Arithmetic Engine" can do different operations on 2 inputs. But you need to be able to do both in the same circuit. To do this, build a "decoder", which will decide which mode our computer is in, based on the 2 bits we haven't used yet.

In this level you only get one input, we call this the initial seed. The seed is put through the following steps to produce a pseudo random number.

In the algorithm below, "shl 1" means shift left once, "shl 2" means shift left twice and "shr 1" means shift right once.

[b]8 bit xorshift RNG:[/b][code][color=#87a8c8]
temp1     = seed  xor (seed  shr 1)
temp2     = temp1 xor (temp1 shl 1)
next_seed = temp2 xor (temp2 shr 2)
[/color][/code]
Next output next_seed mod 4, to move the robot. Finally use next_seed (before mod 4) as the seed to get the next number in the dance sequence and repeat.

(Notice the initial seed will never be 0)

Welcome to the sandbox. 

Components are available in the menus on the right side. Once placed, click on the pins of the components and drag to connect them with wire. On the left you will find the UI for the simulation control. Note that you can right click on the "Run faster" button to set target speed.

You can find more information about the simulation in the manual (button is in the top left). Notable features to check out are the "component factory" where you can create your own components and the program component, which lets you define your own assembly.

Add if statements to your circuit. For the if statements, the 2 arguments are compared and if the condition is true, the counter is set to a jump address.
	
The previous instructions had the 4 bytes represent:
[code][color=#87a8c8]OPCODE, ARGUMENT_1, ARGUMENT_2, RESULT[/color][/code]

For if statements the bytes represent:
[code][color=#87a8c8]OPCODE, ARGUMENT_1, ARGUMENT_2, JUMP_ADDRESS[/color][/code]

In addition to the previous opcodes, add:
[code][color=#87a8c8]32 IF_EQUAL
33 IF_NOT_EQUAL
34 IF_LESS
35 IF_LESS_OR_EQUAL
36 IF_GREATER
37 IF_GREATER_OR_EQUAL[/color][/code]

Use unsigned less / greater for the comparisons.

Each opcode does what their name implies. For example the following jumps to byte 16 if REG0 is less than REG1: 
[code][color=#87a8c8]IF_LESS REG0 REG1 16[/color][/code]

Create a circuit that can [SAVE] or [LOAD] a byte.

When the first input bit is [ON], [LOAD] the memory and send it to output.
When the second input bit is [ON], [SAVE] the input byte.

The output has an enable pin, enable it only on [LOAD].

Sometimes it is useful to reuse a section of code. We call these sections "functions". To implement this reuse, one can [color=#e63e5b][url=terminology]jump[/url][/color] to the beginning of the function and jump back again at the end of the function. We call jumping to the function "calling" the function, and jumping back from the function "returning" from the function. 
	
But for this section of code to actually be reusable, the return jump will have to be able to return to different locations, depending on where we called the function from.

We could save the counter value to a register before jumping to the function and use this value when returning. However, if done this way, a function would not be able to call another function, since this would overwrite the original return address.

Say function A calls function B, who calls function C. When we want to return from C, we only need the return address for B and in B we only need the address for A. In general, regardless of which function we look at and how they are nested, the last return address we added is always the first one we will need again. This is exactly the behavior of the stack.

This level has a value input and 3 condition bit inputs.

The 3 bits select the condition as shown below. Check the value against the selected condition and output [ON] if it is satisfied and [OFF] otherwise.

Bit code:        Turn [ON] when:[code]
[OFF] [OFF] [OFF]    Never
[OFF] [OFF] [ON]    If value = 0
[OFF] [ON] [OFF]    If value < 0
[OFF] [ON] [ON]    If value ≤ 0
[ON] [OFF] [OFF]    Always

When we want to determine what components in a circular dependency are outputting, we don't have a first component we can start with. Instead we use the values of the wires from last tick. This is because in real hardware electrons don't travel instantly. Depending on the circuit, the wires either flicker between [ON] and [OFF], or settle in a stable state.
	
When you have a circuit where the wires can settle in either of 2 different stable states, you have a basis for memory. The next state will depend on the values the wires had last tick. Such wires are called "latches".
