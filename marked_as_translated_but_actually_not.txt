This level has a value input and 3 condition bit inputs.

The 3 bits select the condition as shown below. Check the value against the selected condition and output [ON] if it is satisfied and [OFF] otherwise.

Bit code:        Turn [ON] when:[code]
[OFF] [OFF] [OFF]    Never
[OFF] [OFF] [ON]    If value = 0
[OFF] [ON] [OFF]    If value < 0
[OFF] [ON] [ON]    If value ≤ 0
[ON] [OFF] [OFF]    Always
[ON] [OFF] [ON]    If value ≠ 0
[ON] [ON] [OFF]    If value ≥ 0
[ON] [ON] [ON]    If value > 0[/code]

$15754153332116* This level introduces the concept of latches. This mechanic is not necessary to complete the game.
$15213907597666* Using 2 NOR gates, build the circuit that matches the table. You will need a latch.

When we want to determine what components in a circular dependency are outputting, we don't have a first component we can start with. Instead we use the values of the wires from last tick. This is because in real hardware electrons don't travel instantly. Depending on the circuit, the wires either flicker between [ON] and [OFF], or settle in a stable state.
	
When you have a circuit where the wires can settle in either of 2 different stable states, you have a basis for memory. The next state will depend on the values the wires had last tick. Such wires are called "latches".
$18004215603701* Add a counter to the circuit
$56024330661504* Linked component {nr} should point to a register or custom component with a register inside

The following are the set up steps that needs to be done in order to complete this level:
		
[b]1.[/b] Click the schematic icon ([b][i][/i][/b]) and create a new empty architecture.
[b]2.[/b] Place a program block with 4 outputs.
[b]3.[/b] Place a counter, set its increment to 4 and connect it to the program block.
[b]4.[/b] Add 6 registers (or custom components with registers)
[b]5.[/b] Click "Edit link components" on the program component and connect registers to 0 to 5. Connect the counter to 6 and the output to 7.
$11377431500625* Add 6 registers to the map
$62258842382434* Linked component {counter} should point to the counter
